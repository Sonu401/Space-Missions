‚ñ∂Project : Space Missions(Dataset containing all space missions from 1957 to August 2022)

Author: SONU KUMAR KUSHWAHA


The dataset consist of all space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of
the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission. It is downloaded
from Maven Analytics.

Exploration of the universe is the dream of every scientist and to accomplish that dream space missions have taken place
since a long time with some successful attempts and today I am here to analyse about space missions that had taken
place in past to extract some valuable information.

Questions that I tried to answer in dataset¬∂
How have rocket launches trended across time?
Which countries have had the most successful space missions?
Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
Success of mission in comparison to the failure of misson is more or less?
Which company carried most of the space missions?

üöÄ Exciting Project Update:  Space-Missions üìä

I‚Äôm thrilled to share my latest project focusing on  Space-Missions, leveraging the powerful capabilities of Power BI. This project was both challenging and rewarding, and I‚Äôm excited to showcase some of the key highlights and insights gained.

## üîç Project Overview :
The dataset includes details of various space missions from 1957 to August 2022, providing insights into the location, date, and outcome of each launch, along with information about the rocket and the organization responsible.

## üìÅ Launch Locations:
Missions were launched from various locations worldwide, including well-known sites like Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Cape Canaveral AFS in Florida, USA, and many others.

## üìÅ Mission Dates:
The missions span from the dawn of space exploration in 1957, starting with the historic launch of Sputnik-1 by the USSR, up to August 2022.

## üìà Launch Results: :
The dataset records the outcome of each mission, indicating whether it was a success, failure, or had other outcomes.

## üí° Responsible Companies:
Numerous organizations have contributed to space exploration, including government agencies like NASA, Roscosmos, and private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.

## üìÅ Rocket Details::
The data provides the name and status of the rockets used, such as "Sputnik 8K71PS" or "Vanguard," along with their retirement status.

## üìÅ Rocket Price::
The cost of some rockets is included, offering an economic perspective on the missions.

## üìÅ Mission Status:
 Indicates the mission's success, providing a clear view of the performance and reliability of various rockets and companies over time.

## üåü Conclusion:
This project has been a remarkable journey of exploration and learning, From the processing of data and visualisation of data there are some key points that are extracted.

With time number of space missions increased but there's no uniform growth in chances of success.
despite most space missions carried by USA throughout the time but Russia have more successful missions.
Cosmos-3M (11K65M) is mostly used rocket but is now retired from the services.
All the missions that have taken place since now success of the missions are far more than failure.
RVSN USSR clearly is dominating company for most of the space missions that are carried..

Thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this endeavor. I look forward to leveraging these insights for future projects and continuing to drive innovation through data!
